# Welcome to OpenJDK 25 Updates!

The JDK 25 Updates project uses two GitHub repositories.
Updates are continuously developed in the repository [jdk25u-dev](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk25u-dev). This is the repository usually targeted by contributors.
The [jdk25u](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk25u) repository is used for rampdown of the update releases of jdk25u and only accepts critical changes that must make the next release during rampdown. (You probably do not want to target jdk25u).

For more OpenJDK 25 updates specific information such as timelines and contribution guidelines see the [project wiki page](https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/JDKUpdates/JDK+25u/).
